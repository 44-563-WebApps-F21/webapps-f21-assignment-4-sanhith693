    <h4>ACT II.  _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_.</h4>
    
    <p>
    <h6 class="name LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p class="speech">Because he leads such an idle life.</p>

    <h6 class="name MABELCHILTERN">MABEL CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech"> How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row
at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week,
changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night
of the season.  You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?</p>

<h6 class="name LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.]</p>
<p>You are a very charming young lady!</p>

<h6 class="name MABELCHILTERN">ABEL CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech"> How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham!  Do come
to us more often.  You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you
look so well with your star!</p>

<h6 class="name LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6><p class="speech">  Never go anywhere now.  Sick of London Society.
Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the
right side.  But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my
wife’s milliner.  Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets.</p>

<h6 class="name MABEL CHILTERN">MABEL CHILTERN.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh, I love London Society!  I think it has immensely
improved.  It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant
lunatics.  Just what Society should be.</p>
